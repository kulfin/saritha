Online banking is the practice of making bank
transactions or paying bills via the Internet.
Thanks to technology, and the Internet in
particular, people no longer have to leave the
house to shop, communicate, or even do their
banking. Banking online allows a customer to
make deposits, withdrawals, and pay bills all with
the click of a mouse.<br/><br/>

Since the cost to the bank is minimal, the cost to
the consumer, in many cases, is also minimal.
While there may be a fee for some online banking
transactions, they are often extremely low. Those
who use this type of banking often agree it's
worth every penny , and not having to spend all
Saturday morning standing in a crowded bank
line is justification for most. It can even pay for
itself since costs like postage and ATM fees are
reduced.<br/><br/>

Online banking also eliminates paper waste, which
is a plus not only for those who have to handle
all the paper work, but also for the environment.
Of course, there are also disadvantages. Security
is always an issue with Internet transactions.
Although information is encrypted , and the
chances of an account being hacked are slim, it
happens. Banks pay a lot of money to install high
tech firewalls, however, and chances are good that
a customer's money is in good hands.<br/><br/>
