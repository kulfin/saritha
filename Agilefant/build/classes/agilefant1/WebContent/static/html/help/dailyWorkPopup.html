<p>My work view is a personal page for every user, which gathers all your current
tasks and stories into a single view.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;" style="">
  <img src="static/img/help/load_graph.png" alt="" style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;"/>
  <br/>
  <span style="font-style: italic; ">The Load graph calculates the assigned load for a particular user and shows the 
estimate on how much work the user has on average in the coming days.</span>
</div>


<p>
With the task and story queues, you can prioritize your tasks and inform other users what
you are currently or in the near future working on. For the tasks in your task queue, your name appears as <strong>bold</strong> font in the
other views which show your tasks (for example, the iteration view).
